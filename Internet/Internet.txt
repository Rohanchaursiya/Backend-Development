// How does the Internet Works..?
    - As a developer, it is important to have a solid understanding of what the internet is and how it works.
    - It is the foundation upon which most modern software applications are built.
    - In order to build effective, secure, and scalable applications and services,
    - you need to have a solid understanding of how the internet works and how to leverage its power and connectivity.

// introduction to the Network
    - A network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other.

// Introduction to the Internet
    - The internet is a network of networks.
    - The Internet is developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense as a
    - means of creating a decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack.
    - Over the years, it has evolved into a complex and sophisticated network that spans the globe.

// How the Internet Works: An Overview
    - The internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols.
    - These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.
    - The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers.
    - When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router.
    - The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination.
    - This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.
    - To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly,
    - the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    - IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination,
    - TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.
    - there are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet.
    including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol.

// Basic Terminology
    - Packet: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
    - Router: A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
    - IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.
    - Domain Name: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.
    - DNS: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
    - HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
    - HTTPS: An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
    - SSL/TLS: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.

// The Role of protocols in Internet
    - Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet.
    - is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems.

    Types of Protocols
    - IP(Internet Protocol) -> routing packets of data to their correct destination
    - TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) -> ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently.
    - UDP(User Datagram Protocol) -> translate domain names into IP addresses
    - DNS(Domain Name System) -> transfer data between clients and servers.

// Understanding IP Addresses and Domain Names
    IP Address
    - is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.
    - used to route data to the correct destination.
    - ensure that information is sent to the intended recipient.
    - typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods.
    - "192.168.1."

    Domain Names
    - Human-readable names used to identify websites and other internet resources.
    - translated into IP addresses using the Domain Name System.

    DNS
    - When you enter a domain name into your web browser.
    - your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server.
    - which returns the corresponding IP address.

// Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS
    HTTP
    - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    - used to transfer data between a client and a server.
    - request to the server.
    - HTTP response back to the client.

    HTTPS - (HTTP Secure)
    - more secure version of HTTP.
    - encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS encryption.
    - SSL -> Secure Sockets Layer
    - TLS -> Transport Layer Security.

// Building Applications with TCP/IP
    - communication protocol used by most internet-based applications and services.
    - provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.

    Ports
    - used to identify the application or service running on a device.
    - each application or service is assigned a unique port number.
    - allow to sent data to correct destination.

    Sockets
    - It is a combination of an IP address and Port number.
    - represent a specific endpoint for communication.
    - used to establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications.

    Connections
    - It is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other.
    - the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size.
    - which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.

    Data Transfer
    - Once connection is established data is transferred between the applications.
    - Data is typically transmitted in segments.
    - Each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.

    FTP -> File Transfer Protocol
    SMTP -> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

// Securing Internet Communication with SSL/TLS
    - provides secure connections for applications.
    - Web browser, Email clients, and File Transfer Programs.

    Certificates
    - SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server.
    - They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party.

    Handshake
    - During the SSL/TLS handshake process,
    - The client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure connection.

    Encryption
    - Once the secure connection is established,
    - Data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.

// The Future: Emerging Trends and Technologies

    - 5G -> latest generation of mobile network technology, offering faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity than previous generations.
    - Internet of Things -> network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other objects that are connected to the internet and can exchange data.
    - Artificial Intelligence -> machine learning and natural language processing.
    - Blockchain -> is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, decentralized transactions.
    - Edge computing -> Edge computing refers to the processing and storage of data at the edge of the network, rather than in centralized data centers.
